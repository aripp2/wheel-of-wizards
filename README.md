# Wheel of Wizards

### Created By: Amanda Sierra, Gregory Anderson, & Amy Rippeto

## Objective:

As Module 2 students of the Front End Engingeering Program at Turing School of Software & Design we were tasked with recreating the well know game Wheel of Fortune. Our game was built with OOP priciples and TDD. This was our first project using Webpack, a provided fetch API for retrieving our data and incorporating SCSS/SASS for the design.

## Try our Game:

1. Clone down this repo.
2. In your terminal run ```npm install```
3. Next run ```npm start```
4. Now you can go to [in your browser](http://localhost:8080/) to play Wheel of Wizards!
